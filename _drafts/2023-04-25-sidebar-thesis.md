#### Daily Log
##### 19/08/2023
Went to meet Pratik sir regarding work to be done in thesis, what should be the approach, time to be devoted, deliverables etc. He told me that I should work on a completely undiscovered aspect of the project since I am involved full time in the project. He told me to start discovering bokeh rendering. When I am comfortable in it then I should start implementing it in Federated setup. Need to talk to Pallavi ma'am regarding it.

##### 20/08/2023
Talked to Pallavi ma'am about it. We agreed on dividing the tasks. While she works on image restoration, I will work on bokeh rendering. Going through the collected research papers on bokeh rendering.

##### 21/08/2023
Logged in the server via the credentials shared by Pallavi ma'am. Many dependencies need to be installed here for an ML model to run on it. Tried to run <a href="https://github.com/saikatdutta/Stacked_DMSHN_bokeh">this</a> model on the server.

##### 22/08/2023
Not much could be done today since I had to prepare for my placement interview tomorrow.
