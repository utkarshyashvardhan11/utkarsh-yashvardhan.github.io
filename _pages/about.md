<!-- **This website is under construction. Kindly visit later.** -->

I am final year student at BITS Pilani (Pilani Campus) pursuing a dual degree in M.Sc. Mathematics and B.E. Computer Science.

I have done some great projects under professors of BITS Pilani and learned a lot about programming and research while doing those projects. I have also interned at LTI as a backend developer and was the co-lead of the competitive coding SIG in the MLSA, BITS Pilani chapter. I know how to work in a fast-paced environment to give high-quality results.

I also bagged a scholarship in my second semester of college given to the top 2% performers of the batch.

I am particularly interested in ML/DL, algorithms, discrete maths and problem-solving.
