#### Project Description
---
- The project implements a basic system to **manage cab booking** from **both customer’s and driver’s ends**.
- It also shows the **complete journey of the customer** from the source to the destination after the cab booking is finalized.
- Once the trip is completed, the **customer rates the driver** based on his experience.

#### Role in the 2-member team
---
- **Developed the grid**, which shows the customer’s journey from the source to the destination.
- Worked on **creating a multithreaded environment** to get interfaces for the customer and the driver, which can interact with each other.

#### End Result
---
- **Learned** about **how a cab booking system works** and is implemented.
- Got experience in **developing an application using concepts of multithreading**.
- Learned how to work on a project together as a team and **manage the project as a team leader**.
