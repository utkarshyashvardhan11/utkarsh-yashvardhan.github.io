#### Project Description
---
- The project involves **designing** and **developing** a **Compiler for a custom language using C**.
- Design and implementation of the **lexical analyzer** and **parser** for the given custom language are done.
- The project also implements **lexical and parsing error detection** and **parse tree creation** for the given custom
language.

#### Role in the 5-member team
---
- **Implemented** efficient data structures like **Hash Table, Stack, N-ary Tree, and Set**, which were crucial for
compiler implementation.
- Contributed to **designing DFA** for the lexical analyzer phase of the compiler design. Also contributed to **lexical
analyzer development**.
- Contributed to **designing context-free grammar** for the parser phase of the compiler design and **developed
crucial parser functions**.

#### End Result
---
- **Learned** about the **internal functioning of the Compiler**.
- Got experience in **implementing** a complex system like a **Compiler** using just **basic C constructs**.
- Learned how to **cooperate together** as a **team** while working on a **big project**.
